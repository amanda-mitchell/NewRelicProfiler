# NewRelic Agent/Profiler for Mono

Directions (currently really ghetto because it's a proof of concept):

1. Download either of the official .NET NewRelic agents and extract the contents. (you can get it on your Account Settings page)
2. Copy NewRelic.Agent.Core.dll into this directory.
3. Run additions/make.sh.
4. Run profiler/make.sh.
